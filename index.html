      <h3>January 1968: the final year of the United States operated mission "Chrome Dome." </h3>
      <p>
        The United States Air Force B-52 bomber HOBO 28 suffered an internal fire 90 miles south of Thule Air Base in
        Greenland. The crew was forced to request an emergency landing in the Danish territory but would not make it. As
        the fire worsened, electrical power was lost, and smoke rendered their instruments illegible. Of the seven crew
        members, six were able to successfully eject. The seventh member Leonard Svitenko did not have a functional
        ejection seat and suffered a fatal head injury while trying to escape through the hatch. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The unmanned USAF B-52 bomber, carrying four megaton B28FI thermonuclear bombs continued past Thule Air Base and
        crashed on the sea ice of North Star Bay, roughly 7.5 miles west. The explosive charges of all four nuclear
        warheads detonated on impact and spread radioactive material over a large area. 225,000 pounds of burning jet
        fuel
        melted through the ice causing the wreckage and explosives to sink to the ocean floor. Recovery efforts were
        said
        to retrieve 93 percent of contaminated material, yet rumors persisted that the fourth bomb could not be
        recovered
        or was otherwise missing. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of Denmark’s nuclear-free zone policy (1957), the presence of a loaded bomber in their Greenland
        airspace
        triggered public outcry. The suspicion of this policy’s violation would become known as Thulegate.
