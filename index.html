        <h3>January 1968: the final year of the United States operated mission "Chrome Dome." </h3>
        <p>
          The United States Air Force B-52 bomber HOBO 28 suffered an internal fire 90 miles south of Thule Air Base in
          Greenland. The crew was forced to request an emergency landing in the Danish territory but would not make it.
          As
          the fire worsened, electrical power was lost, and smoke rendered their instruments illegible. Of the seven
          crew
          members, six were able to successfully eject. The seventh member Leonard Svitenko did not have a functional
          ejection seat and suffered a fatal head injury while trying to escape through the hatch. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          The unmanned USAF B-52 bomber, carrying four megaton B28FI thermonuclear bombs continued past Thule Air Base
          and
          crashed on the sea ice of North Star Bay, roughly 7.5 miles west. The explosive charges of all four nuclear
          warheads detonated on impact and spread radioactive material over a large area. 225,000 pounds of burning jet
          fuel
          melted through the ice causing the wreckage and explosives to sink to the ocean floor. Recovery efforts were
          said
          to retrieve 93 percent of contaminated material, yet rumors persisted that the fourth bomb could not be
          recovered
          or was otherwise missing. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of Denmark’s nuclear-free zone policy (1957), the presence of a loaded bomber in their Greenland
          airspace
          triggered public outcry. The suspicion of this policy’s violation would become known as Thulegate.

      <h3>January 3106</h3>
      <p>
        Despite various revivals of the START (Strategic Arms Reduction Talks) Treaty over the millennium, alleged
        violations such as those of Thulegate fueled distrust among the world superpowers. Throughout these tensions,
        an
        advanced homebrewed virus has bypassed security of silos across the globe. Thousands of warheads not
        previously
        known to the public have set themselves to deploy and although the superpowers were initially reluctant to
        declare World War III, the first bombs have fallen. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        You are a part of the global underground organization Locus. Teams of thousands spanning across the world all
        working with one goal in mind: to explore and colonize habitable planets outside the solar system. Although
        many
        candidates are known, your role (along with many others) is to set out and discover potentially missed
        Earth-like planets and maximize humanity’s opportunity to survive. The Locus mission “Domus” was not set to
        start for another decade, but with Earth’s cataclysm close on the horizon, the risk must be taken. Only a
        quarter of Domus’s mission will be able to set off. 2000 of the Locus team will be stationed in orbit around
        Earth and await transmission of any potential Earth-likes you scan and encounter. <br>

        Good Luck. <br>
