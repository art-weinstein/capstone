### Plan of attack


1. Create functionality to generate a random planet 
2. Start a basic text game
3. Create initial files
4. Create and store a username
5. Users will do this through a login or accoutn creation option
6. Upon logging in, will be redirected to the first page of the game
7. welcome user
8.
